# Airlabs-API-Data

This is a personal project illustrating my ability to work with API data using my programming language of choice - R. In this project, I use the Airlabs API to get real-time data about flights.

The output was a simple [shiny application](https://smartpath.shinyapps.io/AirLabsNearByAPI/) to help users (specifically travelers & researchers) know nearest departure airport or all available airports within a given radius at a click of a button using the [AirLabs NearBy API.](https://airlabs.co/docs/nearby)
